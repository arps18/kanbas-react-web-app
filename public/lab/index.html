    <p>When you visit a Webpage on your browser, you are viewing a document formatted using the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML documents are plain text documents that can be edited with any text editor. We refer to the software layer that interacts directly with a human as the front end. As we demanded more from our Webpages, the industry evolved techniques, tools and frameworks to deal with the growing complexity. Many techniques were borrowed from other engineering fields. Today's front end frameworks implement advanced software engineering techniques and design patterns such as: Object oriented programming, Component technology, Singletons, Services, Model view controller.
